            <h1><b>My Current Projects</b></h1>
            <p>
                I am working on a group project in my Software Engineering class. The final product is going to be a web-based 
                application that will take user input on living conditions and output recommended locations that the 
                user may like to live in and near. It will make these recommendations using climate data from the 
                <a href="https://noaa.gov">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)</a>, as well as other 
                data from the <a href="https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com">Microsoft Planetary Computer</a>, such as 
                population density and building density.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am working with <a href="https://aiwvu.orgs.wvu.edu">Artificial Intelligence WVU</a> 
                on various projects. We are trying to get data from the 
                <a href="https://prt.wvu.edu">West Virginia University Personal Rapid Transport (PRT)</a> to create an AI model 
                that will work to optimize the PRT system and/or provide estimates of the amount of time repairs will take 
                and help estimate when they will be needed ahead of time.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://aiwvu.orgs.wvu.edu">Artificial Intelligence WVU</a> is also working with the 
                <a href="https://gamedevclub.orgs.wvu.edu/">WVU Game Developers Club</a> on a collaborative project.
                The Game Developers Club is creating a racing game, which will be given to us (AIWVU) to create an 
                AI model that will be given a month to train and improve at the game. After the training is done, 
                we will host a joint event between the clubs allowing people to try to compete against the 
                AI and have fun testing to see whether the AI is better than humans at the game.
